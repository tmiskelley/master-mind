# mastermind
This repository is a command line/terminal recreaction of the classic children's 
game "Mastermind." in which the computer randomly generates a secret code, and 
prompts the user to guess what it is. The computer provides feedback on each 
attempt to guide the player toward the correct code, but if the user fails to correctly guess the code after 12 attempts, the player loses and a new game is started automatically.
